## üìå Problem Statement

**Problem Statement 3 ‚Äì Real-Time Data Experiences with Fluvio**

---

## üéØ Objective

AutoAgentDesk addresses the challenges of log analytics and querying by providing an AI-powered solution that simplifies the process. It enables users to interact with logs in natural language, analyze them in real-time, and generate actionable insights.

- **Problem:**  
  - Log analytics is time-consuming and complex, especially with large datasets from multiple sources.
  - Traditional tools lack real-time capabilities and require manual intervention.
- **Solution:**  
  - AutoAgentDesk automates log analytics and querying with an AI agent that supports natural language interaction.
  - It provides real-time insights, report generation, and multi-source log integration.
- **Target Audience:**  
  - Developers, DevOps engineers, and data analysts.
  - Organizations needing real-time log monitoring and analytics.
- **Value Proposition:**  
  - Saves time and reduces complexity in log analysis.
  - Makes log querying accessible to non-technical users.
  - Enables faster issue resolution with real-time capabilities.

## API Endpoints
- `/logs`: Endpoint for analyzing logs. You can access this endpoint to send log data to the AI agent for analysis. The agent will process the logs and return insights based on the data.
- `/queries`: Endpoint for querying logs. You can send a query to this endpoint, and the AI agent will return the relevant log data.
`curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/queries/" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "What WARN level logs occurred in the API service in the last 24 hours?", "max_logs": 100}'`
- `/report`: Endpoint for generating reports. You can send a request to this endpoint, and the AI agent will generate a report based on the log data. (yet to be implemented)
