## üèÅ Final Words
My hackathon journey building AutoAgentDesk has been both challenging and rewarding! Here's a glimpse into my experience:

### Challenges & Learnings
- Working with ChromaDB's query format was a significant hurdle. When implementing filters, I discovered that ChromaDB has specific requirements for field names and operators. After debugging the "Invalid where clause" errors, I learned the importance of proper field name mapping and using the correct query operators (`$in` vs `$eq`).
- The context variable definition bug in the LogAnalysisAgent class taught me to be more careful about variable scoping in asynchronous Python code. Always capture return values!
- Balancing token limits with comprehensive log analysis was tricky. I developed a smart log prioritization system that ensures critical database and memory-related errors are never truncated, even when dealing with thousands of logs.

### Technical Insights
- Integrating Groq's API was seamless once I understood its token limitations. The performance improvement over other models for this specific use case was impressive - responses are noticeably faster.
- Building a context-aware AI agent that maintains conversation history and previous findings created a more natural and insightful user experience than I initially expected.

### Community & Inspiration
- Special thanks to the Groq and InfinyOn teams for their documentation and sample projects that helped make integration smoother.

I'm excited to continue developing AutoAgentDesk beyond this hackathon, with plans to implement the alerting system and ReactJS frontend improvements next. This project has deepened my understanding of AI-assisted observability tools and real-time data processing architectures.

## API Endpoints
- `/logs`: Endpoint for analyzing logs. You can access this endpoint to send log data to the AI agent for analysis. The agent will process the logs and return insights based on the data.
- `/queries`: Endpoint for querying logs. You can send a query to this endpoint, and the AI agent will return the relevant log data.
`curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/queries/" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "What WARN level logs occurred in the API service in the last 24 hours?", "max_logs": 100}'`
- `/report`: Endpoint for generating reports. You can send a request to this endpoint, and the AI agent will generate a report based on the log data. (yet to be implemented)
